Calculator that doesn't totally work. Some issues with operation stack, can't handle parenthesis

Doubly Linked List works fine and is an example of a doubly linked list using queues and stacks. The templated version allow for different types of data to be used in this structure. Commented out are string, double, int. Just use whichever you want and update in the /Double Linked List/main.cpp

Calculator has some small issues. Can't handle parenthesis or variable substitution, but I think these are easy fixes (I was on a stressful deadline when I made this)
